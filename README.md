#### Projects & Work Highlights

**🔹 Machine Learning Projects:**  
I am working on a variety of machine learning projects, where I experiment with **classification models** such as **Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Trees**. My most recent project involves applying **K-Means clustering** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for research paper classification. Additionally, I have deployed a Flask-based app for abstract classification to demonstrate my end-to-end data science pipeline skills.

**🔹 Power BI Dashboards:**  
From **Employee Insights** to **Insurance** and **E-Learning Platforms**, I’ve built dynamic dashboards that showcase insightful data visualizations and comprehensive reporting. My current focus is on creating a **financial dataset dashboard** and developing an **EdTech platform overview**, offering key metrics such as enrollment trends and course statistics.

**🔹 AdventureWorks & Sakila Database Analysis:**  
Using the **AdventureWorks DW** and **Sakila** databases, I’ve performed extensive analysis on sales data, employee performance, and customer demographics. I have also designed dashboards to simplify business intelligence reporting, adding features like filters, slicers, and complex DAX measures for deeper insights.

**🔹 Automated Literature Review System (Ongoing):**  
Currently designing and implementing a system architecture for an **Automated Literature Review** using **text classification** techniques. This project involves **EDA**, **TF-IDF feature engineering**, and **supervised/unsupervised learning** for categorizing research paper abstracts.
